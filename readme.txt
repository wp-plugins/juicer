Juicer is a beautiful social media feed generator that you can embed on any page.

== Description ==
Juicer is a service that allows you to enter in the name of your social media accounts (or, if you prefer, hashtags) and Juicer will automatically pull the posts from these feeds and embed them into any of your pages with an easy shortcode. Juicer will automatically update these feeds whenever you create posts for your social media accounts.

To use this plugin you must create an account on [http://www.juicer.io](http://www.juicer.io). Then you must create a feed and add social media sources to it.

= Features =

* A beautiful feed of your social media content from basically networks: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google Plus, Tumblr, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, and RSS.
* Gather your content by @username or #hashtag
* Setup rules & filters to automatically eliminate unwanted content retweets and duplicate posts.
* Moderate and remove your social media content with one click.
* Permalinks to each of your social media posts, optimized for SEO.
* Responsive grid for dynamic layouts.
* Infinite scroll: load more content simply by scrolling to the bottom of the page.
* Auto-approve all your user generated content, or set up auto-moderation filters.
* Custom CSS: Style it to fit your brand or site.
* Advanced Analytics: Find out who uses your social feed, and how they interact with it.

== Installation ==
Download the plugin zip file, unzip it, and upload it to your wordpress site under the /wp-includes/plugins directory.

Sign up via [http://www.juicer.io](http://www.juicer.io) and create a feed for free

One you've done that you can use the shortcode: `[juicer name='YOUR_FEED_NAME']` in any post or page

To get your Juicer feed name:

- Sign into your account on http://www.juicer.io
- Navigate to http://www.juicer.io/feeds
- Click "Edit" on the feed you wish to embed
- You should be taken to a url like http://www.juicer.io/feeds/juicer
- The 'juicer' portion of the url is your feed name.
- To use a shortcode for the embed feed try `[juicer name='juicer']`
- Make sure you replace the `name` above with your feeds name.

Alternately, you can add the feed to your template directly if you like using PHP. Here's an example: `<?php juicer_feed('name=juicer'); ?>`

= Advanced Usage =

There are a few more parameters you can add to your shortcode / php function that will allow you to limit the number of posts that show up:

`per`is the number of posts you want to show up on a page. Default is 100

`pages` is the number of times you want the feed to add more posts as you scroll (This is known as infinite scroll). By default there is no limit to the number of pages, it will keep going until you've seen all the posts in your feed. If you only want it to add more posts once as you scroll set this to "2" for example.

So if you wanted your feed to only ever display 15 posts you should do something like this:

`[juicer name='YOUR_FEED_NAME' per='15' pages='1']`

or

`<?php juicer_feed('name=juicer&per=15&pages=1'); ?>`

This will show 15 posts, and ensure that your feed doesn't load any posts beyond the first page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Juicer? =
[Juicer](http://www.juicer.io) is a service that allows you to create an embeddable feed of all your social media accounts. It's great for increasing brand awareness and engagment and for providing fresh and interesting content for your website with very little work. It auto updates every day, pulling in any new posts, so your feed will always be fresh with your latest social media posts.

= How much does it cost? =
Juicer is free forever. No really! There is a paid account that gives you added features like adding more social media accounts, creating multiple feeds and getting detailed social analytics. But if you just want a feed for your website, it's free forever!

= I only want a few posts showing up, not a huge feed! =
Not a problem! There's a few different ways we can handle this:

**Use our widget:** Log on to your [Juicer account](http://www.juicer.io) and click on "Edit" for your feed. Then click on "Feed Settings" and change your "Feed Style" to "Widget". This specific style shows just a single post at a time, and slides through them. It's simple and beautiful and perfect for putting in a sidebar or a footer, without taking up as much room as a normal juicer feed.

**Limit the number of posts:** If you want to use a normal Juicer feed, but you don't want it to be super long there are some additional attributes you can pass into the short code or function `per` and `pages`:

`per` is the number of posts you want to show up on a page. Default is 100

`pages` is the number of times you want the feed to add more posts as you scroll (This is known as infinite scroll). By default there is no limit to the number of pages, it will keep going until you've seen all the posts in your feed. If you only want it to add more posts once as you scroll set this to "2" for example.

So if you wanted your feed to only ever display 15 posts you should do something like this:

`[juicer name='YOUR_FEED_NAME' per='15' pages='1']`

or

`<?php juicer_feed('name=juicer&per=15&pages=1'); ?>`

This will show 15 posts, and ensure that your feed doesn't load any posts beyond the first page.
